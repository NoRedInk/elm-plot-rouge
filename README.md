# elm-plot-rouge

Hi! First of all: If you're looking to a plotting library
use [elm-plot](https://github.com/terezka/elm-plot) instead! This library is not
made to be userfriendly. If you feel like you're missing something in elm-plot,
you're welcome to open an issue in the repo and I'll see what I can do
to accommodate your needs.
